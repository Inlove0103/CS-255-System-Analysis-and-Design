DriverPass Project
Client: DriverPass, a company offering online driver education and behind-the-wheel training
System Type: The client reqeuested a comprehensive web-based system to manage student enrollement, scheduling,
progress, and communication between instructors and learners. The goal was to streamline operations
and enhance user experience for both staff and students. 
I excelled at translating certain requirements into a modular, scable system design. My documentation needed to 
clearly outlined system components, data flow, and user interactions. Additionally, I also had to prioritize
the accessability and usability, ensuring that the design could adapt to the real-world constraints and user
feedback. On the other hand, if I could revise one part, I would like to improve on constructing diagrams, that can 
refelct the connection with user to customers. I would like to add more detail around exception handling and 
system responses to user errors, making the duagrams more realistic and easy to understand the connection.
I focused on understanding the user journey and analyzing poiints and desired outcomes. I implemented
features that would support user friendly expectations such as notifications systems to align with user expectations. I 
took in consideration that user needs is essential because it ensure the system is not just functional, 
but intuitive and empowering. I approach software design by breaking down requirements into functional 
steps, then use techniques like sequence and activity diagrams to bring more visual to the workflow. With future projects,
I'll continue using these strategies while incorporatingn more agile practivies and real-time prototyping
to validate assumptions early on.
